## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

This repository currently contains 3 plugins. ID Tag Adder, Source Adder, and nHentai Lookup Using Hdoujin.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

In order to install the plugins go to the homepage of LANraragi click on "Settings" then "Plugin Configuration" then "Upload Plugin" at the bottom. At this point just select the plugins you want to install and click open. TIP: You can install as many plugins as you want at once. No need to upload plugins one at a time.

## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Once you installed the plugins give the page a refresh so you can see the plugins. All three plugins are under the "Metadata Plugins" tab. The only setting for each of the plugins is a toggle for the "Auto-Plugin" setting. What this means is it will run the plugin if Shinobu detects a new manga/comic. You can use all three plugins with the "Batch Tagging", but be warned that the "nHentai Lookup Using Hdoujin" plugin does ping the nHentai servers and you can get IP banned. If you want to use this plugin with batch tagging I recommend using a 15-20 second delay between each archive.
